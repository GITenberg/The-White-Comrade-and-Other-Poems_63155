<p class="t3">
  <i>A Canadian soldier, wounded at Ypres, speaks</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  So this green land is England!  Her we saw<br />
  Radiant and smiling in our early dreams,<br />
  A land by love dream-haunted.  Now we come<br />
  With stranger vision than our youth could give<br />
  To the great shelter of her mighty arms.<br />
  We come from battles bitter and long fought<br />
  To see the stars shining on village streets<br />
  And watch a country in midsummer calm&mdash;<br />
  A soft land, lying August-clad but chill,<br />
  Dull to Canadian eyes that know the sun<br />
  As it stalks red across an azure sky.<br />
  And as we limp about and smoke, play cards,<br />
  And wait impatient to be off again,<br />
  Sometimes we two, amid the comrades here,&mdash;<br />
  Two only of the three who started out,<br />
  For, in the wood at Julien, Edward fell&mdash;<br />
  Sometimes we two go silent, then look up<br />
  To see if we can find in others' eyes<br />
  A knowledge that has grown with us from out<br />
  The fields of France, when in those awful nights,<br />
  <i>Some of us heard a rumor, saw a Form.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we look back unto that strange new hour<br />
  When time was suddenly transformed for us<br />
  Within a sleepy town near old Quebec.<br />
  We, sunburned, and already turning home<br />
  From a long forest tramp of two good weeks,<br />
  We who were friends together, town and school<br />
  And lives in common, knitting us akin.<br />
  We had been tramping through the distant hills<br />
  Far out of reach of papers and of news<br />
  And when we stopped for letters, it was there<br />
  We met the first surprising note of war:<br />
  A little bill-board like a clarion voice<br />
  Shouted to us on that midsummer day,<br />
  "Germany says!"  And on and on and on<br />
  The fateful message ran.  We turned and stared<br />
  Into each other's eyes in blank amaze.<br />
  "Germany says!"  In two short weeks of time<br />
  Hidden by forests as we three had been<br />
  Could all the world be humbled so that news<br />
  Of Germany, and what she says or does<br />
  Or does not say or do, could raise the storm<br />
  Whose thunders shook us even from afar.<br />
  "Belgium is entered!"  "England is prepared!"<br />
  "Canada mobilizing!"  Oh, ye gods,<br />
  What things to read upon a little board<br />
  Tacked up above the place where letters lie!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Later, we asked for ours, and they were full<br />
  Of a new wonder and a great surprise.<br />
  My little sister wrote, "I never dreamed<br />
  That things could happen in this prosy town;<br />
  But everyone is stirring and awake.<br />
  Red Cross is starting, and each girl I know<br />
  Has sent for wool.  For we must learn to knit."<br />
  Then Edward broke his printed envelope:<br />
  "Insurance premiums for the risk in war."<br />
  The air went chill as at a sudden blast.<br />
  Nigel put his away.  Nor opened it.<br />
  His letters must be read quite out of sight.<br />
  To-day I think he did not want to read.<br />
  To-morrow he would see her.  And the word<br />
  Upon all lips would come into their eyes.<br />
  We talked with village gossips all day long,<br />
  We heard their suppositions, hopes and fears,<br />
  We tried to puzzle out those buried weeks,<br />
  When, out of sight and sound, such things had come<br />
  Upon the world we knew, that it no more<br />
  Was our same world.  And we, in forest ways<br />
  Had been quite lost while it was changing.  Strange<br />
  Past anything that we had dreamed before!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We climbed the hill behind the little town<br />
  And as we sat the gathering darkness fell,<br />
  The lights sprang up within the window panes<br />
  And some young boy had found a penny flute<br />
  Which through the gloaming sounded thin and clear<br />
  Like an emphatic fairy note, that called<br />
  To all the spirits that could hear its voice<br />
  To come and follow, follow where it led.<br />
  All here and there that shrill young flute cried "Come."<br />
  And sometimes laughter followed in its train.<br />
  We knew that children catching the refrain<br />
  Would follow, follow on all luring led<br />
  By that young voice through lands of summer night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In the first bird note of St. Julien<br />
  I heard that flute again from hills of home,<br />
  When we three sat on that strange August night<br />
  And tried to talk and felt our own words fail,<br />
  But stared through violet shadows and knew then<br />
  That worlds might fall away and new ones dawn,<br />
  But never in this world more vital hours<br />
  Could come for Canada, or for ourselves<br />
  Than these midsummer days when all the land<br />
  Must ask a vital question&mdash;and reply.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we became new soldiers in a cause<br />
  That is as old as Christ, the crucified.<br />
  As we took drill out in the open air,<br />
  Drank the long draughts of ozone keen and bright,<br />
  Felt our whole bodies grow as if new-born,<br />
  Our minds kept pace and fed on wider thoughts.<br />
  Each man I think who was in truth a man,<br />
  Felt the old life slip from him in those days<br />
  And a new purpose take the place of self.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so we left Valcartier, and stole out<br />
  Across the ocean&mdash;that long line of ships,<br />
  "The New Armada," trailing slowly out<br />
  Across that bridge of water to the land<br />
  Where life and death indeed had met as one.<br />
  Where life and death so closely were entwined<br />
  You could not tell where one began or ceased.<br />
  We did not talk of these things at the time<br />
  But each man, as he smoked and shuffled cards,<br />
  Or drilled his squad upon the sunny deck,<br />
  Each man was conscious through that great good time<br />
  That into life a nobler friend had come<br />
  To be denied or loved as each one chose.<br />
  A strong inevitable friend, so near<br />
  That we should touch him in the passing soon:<br />
  That young-old friend that life has long named Death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At Salisbury we lived and moved in mud.<br />
  Talked mud, felt mud, and slept in it knee-deep.<br />
  England we felt not.  Only lived the day,<br />
  And fell at night to leaden dreams of home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then France, and sudden springtime bourgeoning.<br />
  Oh, bourgeoning indeed with ardent hopes!<br />
  I cannot tell you what that change was like:<br />
  I wish that words were colours, or were notes,<br />
  Then I would go past red to violet tones<br />
  To give you back that vibrancy of air,<br />
  That selfless, sacrificing, vital mood,<br />
  That almost jocund feeling of rebound<br />
  Towards the fight for liberty and right<br />
  That animated France those first spring days.<br />
  The year was young, and in the lovely land<br />
  New life was waking ardent, eager-eyed.<br />
  The very air called welcome, and we left<br />
  Homesickness far behind.  We summoned mirth<br />
  And whistled down those roads all poplar lined.<br />
  We laughed at mud that April winds would dry,<br />
  And in that grey square Market Place at ...<br />
  Where we marched past the staff and gave salute<br />
  There was baptized a new affinity,<br />
  Young Canada with France and England blent.<br />
  I tell you hearts beat faster, hopes rode high,<br />
  The air was lighter, keener, there was joy,<br />
  Great joy in our swift entrance to the fight<br />
  That closed about us fast those April days.<br />
  I think that never in its hottest hour<br />
  Was love so lovely or life so supreme<br />
  As in the sudden days of leaf and bud,<br />
  Of bird song, and that quickening of the heart<br />
  That heralds Great Adventure to the soul.<br />
  There was the night we marched on Neuve Chapelle:<br />
  Thousands of shadows in a shadow host.<br />
  Beyond lay German legions, and that zone<br />
  Invisible, illusive, moving on<br />
  That men have called "The Front."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy your heart<br />
  Moving with other shadows all that night,<br />
  Knowing yourself not flesh at all, but one&mdash;<br />
  One pulse-beat in the world's great heart of flame.<br />
  Perhaps a whistling youth on days of sun,<br />
  One among shadows on this night of nights,<br />
  Moving with other shadows all night long.<br />
  One leaving little loves far, far behind,<br />
  One pressing on with thousands of his kind<br />
  To answer that great question life had asked<br />
  Each one upon his hilltop back at home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We three marched near together through old France,<br />
  Together trenched those days at Neuve Chapelle,<br />
  And saw the heavens part and fires descend,<br />
  And felt the roar of such a cannonade<br />
  As all the world of battles had not known.<br />
  The French lay close beside us, and near them<br />
  The lithe, brown men from India&mdash;heroes they.<br />
  We felt like children just discarding toys<br />
  In face of those whose souls had long known war,<br />
  Whose spirits flashed like rapiers in the face<br />
  Of the Great Danger.  They were men indeed<br />
  Whom it was good to look upon and know,<br />
  And in those nights they learned of us to say,<br />
  When German flares lit up the evening skies,<br />
  "Behold the Northern Lights!"  St. Julien came,<br />
  And that wild night in which old Edward fell.<br />
  Those hours are hard to speak about at all.<br />
  They went by like a flash in which we moved<br />
  As one man altogether, and the hours<br />
  Flared up to heaven like a burning torch.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nigel and I, one night just after Ypres,<br />
  Were struggling with our ancient college-French<br />
  Talking, or stumbling into talk, with one<br />
  Called René Paule, from an adjacent trench,<br />
  Who had been wounded in an early fight.<br />
  And he with eloquence and poetry<br />
  Like all his vivid race, made haste to tell<br />
  Of a strange rumor we had heard before,<br />
  How in the depths of plain unvarnished hell<br />
  Quivering with anguish so he could not move<br />
  And waiting for the stretcher-bearers' call,<br />
  He suddenly felt healing, cool and sweet,<br />
  As you might feel a fan on a hot day<br />
  Swayed by an unseen hand.  And softly then<br />
  Closing his eyes on blessed, stealing sleep<br />
  He felt a touch, and looking up beheld<br />
  The kindest, sweetest eyes in all the world.<br />
  It was a Comrade in the khaki brown,<br />
  His face was tired, but the eyes were keen<br />
  And tender as a dewy flower at dawn.<br />
  And René, feeling once again the pain,<br />
  Grasped the hand tight, and looked into the eyes<br />
  For succor, and they held him there, serene,<br />
  And slowly, slowly conquered the strong pain.<br />
  And René saw the khaki melt away<br />
  Until the Comrade seemed all wrapt in white<br />
  As though sheer light had woven a robe for him,<br />
  And his strong eyes gleamed like an azure flame,<br />
  And he held René through the bitter night,<br />
  Until the stretcher-bearers came at dawn.<br />
  "So the White Comrade often comes, my friends,"<br />
  He said to us, and smiling, mused awhile.<br />
  "These fields are not so difficult in death;<br />
  Whether we live or die it all seems one.<br />
  He has come back to us because we die<br />
  As He did, long ago, for love of man."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Often we talked of Edward, and he seemed<br />
  To march beside us down the bright French roads.<br />
  We moved into the firing line once more.<br />
  So close the German lines, there only lay<br />
  An orchard, in the loveliness of May,<br />
  Between us and the armies of the Huns.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes I think that Festubert will hold<br />
  Rank equal with St. Julien, for those<br />
  Who lived through its abandonment of fire.<br />
  It was the Gunners' day.  We had to shell<br />
  Those trenches that were fortresses indeed,<br />
  And pouring hell's own native thunder out.<br />
  The orchard lay between us, and it seemed<br />
  We simply had to take that place by storm.<br />
  They tried to ditch us with their hedge of wire;<br />
  We plunged and made for gaps, and all the while<br />
  They rained on us artillery fire, until<br />
  Ear drums were stilled and nerves quite ceased to work;<br />
  Machine gun, shrapnel, rifle-fire as one<br />
  Kept up the deadly dance of death.  And we<br />
  Dashed at them, through that dance, till hand to hand<br />
  We cleared our orchard, or they say we did.<br />
  It was the Gunners' Day.  I know that much.<br />
  Some of the fun I missed, for at the height,<br />
  Just when is lost completely every thought<br />
  Of one's own entity, or reason why<br />
  It is not, after all, good sport to die<br />
  In such a whirlwind of emotion,&mdash;then,<br />
  Out of a little puff of air it came,<br />
  The one shot meant for me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell inert<br />
  And sank into unconsciousness, till one<br />
  Dragging me off made torture of my wound,<br />
  Then left me under some small spreading shrubs.<br />
  Surely one needed shelter from the sun<br />
  And hottest air that ever poured on pain.<br />
  I longed for water, looked for human aid,<br />
  But no one came.  Only the roar of guns<br />
  And a far distant sound that meant the play<br />
  Of men in action, that and drilling pain<br />
  Met in a hideous duet of war.<br />
  I called to Nigel with my aching mind<br />
  And knew it was in vain.  Again I called<br />
  To youth, and to some Force in other worlds<br />
  That might put me to death or ease my pain.<br />
  A thousand swords were running through my brain,<br />
  The blood thumped like an engine in my head.<br />
  If I should faint the Comrade White might come!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only in dreams, in dying dreams of pain<br />
  He comes, I thought.  Or else it is quite vain<br />
  To trust such fairy tales as René told.<br />
  Oh, for a glass of water!  It was noon<br />
  And o'er the grassy plain the sleepy hum<br />
  Of insects, moving in a drowsy swoon,<br />
  Sang to me through my pain, as if they were<br />
  A near vibration of the guns of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "War, war, O hot and hideous and hard,<br />
  The ways you lead, the deaths you make one die!<br />
  I have died fifty times this noon!"  So ran<br />
  The anguished brain within me, on and on,<br />
  All the long way of quivering mortal woe.<br />
  The world was gone.  I, swooning, felt it go,<br />
  Was at the point of nothingness, when there,<br />
  Moving across the grass on hands and knees,<br />
  I saw a brown-clad figure crawling slow<br />
  As if he were a part of the hot plain,<br />
  And wondered if I'd last until he came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Never that troop of angels in the air<br />
  At Mons showed brighter wings or lovelier light<br />
  Than the worn khaki of that Comrade dear.<br />
  I felt him bind my wounds with tender touch,<br />
  And at his touch the ghosts of pain escaped.<br />
  I saw him smile above me, and I swooned<br />
  For joy of waking up not all alone.<br />
  I begged "Stay with me till they come!" and then<br />
  Looked up into his face for the first time<br />
  And saw it was old Edward who had died<br />
  At Julien.  We left him lying there<br />
  White in the moonlight as we all rushed on.<br />
  We buried him, Edward the loved and brave,<br />
  And now I stared through pain and saw his face.<br />
  I saw his eyes, shining and lit with love:<br />
  The old eyes, staunch and loyal as they were<br />
  All through our youth together, and these days<br />
  Of the great camaraderie of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Edward," I murmured, and he only smiled<br />
  And waved across the grass right at the guns<br />
  Whose thunder sounded fainter in my ears.<br />
  "How did you come?" I asked him, as I held<br />
  Tight to his hand, that big brown hand of his.<br />
  Oh, it was good to die and have him back!<br />
  For I had died.  That was quite clear to me.<br />
  He only said, "The pain will go, old chap!"<br />
  Just the same voice, with the accustomed burr<br />
  Of his Scotch father sounding through its tones.<br />
  And we sat silent in the burning noon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then in the distance two small figures moved,<br />
  A third behind them, and I knew the boys<br />
  Bearing the stretchers were quite close at hand,<br />
  And Edward waved them so they came on fast.<br />
  To have him leave me!  That were a new death<br />
  And something told me that he could not stay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I long to die, just now, before they come!"<br />
  This I told Edward with what strength I had.<br />
  And he laughed softly, and I held his hand,<br />
  Looked at him long, until the blinding noon<br />
  Came to bend down between us, and his face,<br />
  Tender and brown and kindly, seemed enwrapt<br />
  In a white light, mysterious and strong,<br />
  Turning the khaki silver.  And the hand<br />
  Holding me fast was part of the great light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I closed my eyes.  And now the boys had come,<br />
  Lifted me up, taken me quite away<br />
  To a camp hospital where Nigel lay<br />
  Wounded as I was, out of all vain hope<br />
  Of further fighting for a long half year.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The stretcher-bearers story?  It was this:<br />
  That a strange glow had rested on the shrubs<br />
  'Neath which I lay&mdash;just a broad patch of light<br />
  To show there was a human being there<br />
  In need of human aid.  And so they came.<br />
  "You were half gone, my friend," they said to me,<br />
  "It was a wonder that we saw you there!<br />
  Strange that the sun so centred on that spot!"<br />
  And Nigel, when I told him, said "I think<br />
  You were mistaken, but I dare not say<br />
  What is revealed to any man these days.<br />
  You know the angels that appeared at Mons!<br />
  Many have seen bright angels on the field.<br />
  I have not seen, but then my eyes are dim,<br />
  My vision turns back home so constantly.<br />
  If I were dying I should think of her,<br />
  She is my Christ, my angel and my hope.<br />
  Before each battle I make prayers to her,<br />
  And so the earthly love is still my goal.<br />
  There are two Comrades, Love and Loneliness,<br />
  Perhaps Christ enters when we touch the last.<br />
  Loneliness waiteth long, until we give<br />
  The last glad hold we have on life, and I&mdash;<br />
  I have not given yet my hold on life."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now in this green England that we saw<br />
  Radiant and smiling in our early dreams,<br />
  We two are marking time, looking at hills<br />
  And these small village streets, and playing cards<br />
  And telling yarns, and idling in the sun.<br />
  And as we limp about and wait, sing songs,<br />
  Exchange the tales of trench and hot assault<br />
  And hear again the whistling shrapnel call,<br />
  Muse in the firelight, laugh at old alarms,<br />
  And wait impatient to be off again,<br />
  Sometimes we two, amid the comrades here,<br />
  Sometimes we two go silent.  Then look up<br />
  To see if we can find in others' eyes<br />
  A knowledge that has grown with us from out<br />
  The fields of France, when in those awful nights<br />
  <i>Some of us heard a rumor, saw a Form.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so, my friends, this word I bring to you<br />
  Hot from the hell of conflict whence I come,<br />
  Where life and death, binding men's spirits close,<br />
  Have sealed a certain knowledge on our souls.<br />
  Christ has come back to earth in these great days,<br />
  I, but a young Canadian, tell you this.<br />
  The stories of our battles,&mdash;Neuve Chapelle,<br />
  St. Julien, Festubert, and all the rest&mdash;<br />
  They have been told already scores of times,<br />
  Sung, written, painted, burned in words of flame.<br />
  My words are homely as a tallow dip,<br />
  As crude as that, but just as stoutly true.<br />
  Christ has come back to earth in these great days,<br />
  He has come back, as in the centuries past<br />
  He suddenly appeared upon the streets<br />
  Of old Judean towns.  Let people talk<br />
  Of ancient creeds and dogmas as they will,<br />
  That helps not, hinders not, the vital truth<br />
  That one young man in his most ardent youth<br />
  So loved life, felt life, understood its laws,<br />
  So took pain to his heart, so took great love,<br />
  And knew that pain and love are always one,<br />
  And knew that death can be lived through to life,<br />
  Till he commanded death, and death obeyed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So comes the Comrade White, down silent pain.<br />
  He comes to woods and battlefields to-day,<br />
  (Sometimes I think he loves the woods the best)<br />
  And finds free souls flung skyward, glad to go.<br />
  Among the lonely and the pain-racked ones<br />
  He comes&mdash;not death at all, but radiant life,<br />
  Comes in the eyes of comrades, lives in hearts<br />
  That give all, taking nothing in return.<br />
  He is a rumor and a far white light,<br />
  He is the singing bird, the children's flute<br />
  That called us wooing forth to give our all.<br />
  The floating glad things of the buoyant air,<br />
  Young earth's warm children, music and delight,<br />
  Live in His eyes: those deathless azure eyes,<br />
  That smile upon the moment we thought hard,<br />
  And turn our sacrifice to kindling light.<br />
  <i>They pass through radiant gates on whom He smiles.</i><br />

  THE AWAKENING
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  How like a giant stretching in the sun,<br />
  We have slept through the ages; even we<br />
  Whom the gods moulded for a people free,<br />
  And made tremendous for the race not run.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  See we have slept a magic cycle round,<br />
  And in the dream we have imagined much;<br />
  Felt the soft wings of years we did not touch,<br />
  Dallied with somnolence that deadens sound.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With untried strength what we have done is done.<br />
  The wandering, drowsy brain has vaguely stirred,<br />
  As though from out infinitude it heard<br />
  A great voice speaking from behind the sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Closer and clear the calling, strangely loud,<br />
  And the great country, rousing from long sleep<br />
  Murmurs to its own soul, as deep to deep<br />
  Beckons a day's new dawn, so sure and proud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These were the visions of a passing night,<br />
  Visions now caught in bugle notes of flame,<br />
  <i>And lo, through storms of war we hear our name<br />
  Called by an angel, terrible and bright.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="hearts"></a>
  THE HEARTS OF MOTHERS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The hearts of mothers are hid things<br />
  In these the days of woe,<br />
  And troops of strange thoughts move therein<br />
  Silently to and fro.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They are not thoughts of yester-year,<br />
  Or thoughts of you and me<br />
  And that which we have done, or do,<br />
  By air, or land, or sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But these are thoughts steel-bright with pain,<br />
  And death-thoughts bare and stark,<br />
  And shining thoughts of armaments<br />
  That glitter through the dark.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They move, old passions and revolts,<br />
  Fresh-called, yet stiff with scars,<br />
  To music crimsoned with the clash<br />
  Of endless ancient wars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And those who summon memories<br />
  From pathways of the sun,<br />
  When death spoke life most solemnly<br />
  Ere new life was begun,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They dream of a strange blooming<br />
  That dawns in greater birth:<br />
  The frail, bright flower of selflessness<br />
  Brought back again to earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They feel, the Givers of all Life,<br />
  Great need to give again<br />
  The utmost dower of womanhood,<br />
  All mystery&mdash;all pain.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="soul"></a>
  SOUL OF THE EARTH<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I saw a tired soldier vainly searching<br />
  For room to bury deeply the new dead.<br />
  "The old dead they are there, forever perching<br />
  About the space we need," he grimly said.<br />
  "The old dead, slaughtered, just beneath the sod<br />
  Of Earth that once was well-beloved of God."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard a woman desperate in her wooing<br />
  Of empty space and echoing aisles of air,<br />
  Calling upon the gods of her undoing<br />
  To stem the fearful flood of her despair.<br />
  "Somewhere in France he lies so deep," she said.<br />
  "That Earth must make me answer for my dead."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And all the while a wondrous bloom was springing<br />
  Above the fields where lie these broken boys,<br />
  Thousands of souls like butterflies upwinging<br />
  In troop on radiant troop of shining joys.<br />
  Host upon host they seek eternal breath<br />
  Above the little mounds of lonely death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thus," saith the Earth, "my poppies pass in splendor,<br />
  Flame of young hearts, for still my world is young,<br />
  And in great Ages, wise because more tender,<br />
  The passion of their passing shall be sung.<br />
  Ask of these Ages!  For the soul of me<br />
  Knows endless blooming&mdash;vivid, changing, free."<br />

<a id="gown"></a>
  I USED TO WEAR A GOWN OF GREEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I used to wear a gown of green<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing a song to May,<br />
  When apple blossoms starred the stream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Spring came up the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I used to run along with Love<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By lanes the world forgets,<br />
  To find in an enchanted wood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first frail violets.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And ever 'mid the fairy blooms<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmur of the stream,<br />
  We used to hear the pipes of Pan<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call softly through our dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now, in outcry vast, that tune<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fades like some little star<br />
  Lost in an anguished judgment day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarlet flames of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What can it mean that Spring returns<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purple violets bloom,<br />
  Save that some gypsy flower may stray<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside his nameless tomb!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To pagan Earth her gown of green,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her elfin song to May&mdash;<br />

  And our hearts would send you, as a song of spring,<br />

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
